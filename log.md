**Today's Progress**: Setting up Reactjs enviroment,

**Thoughts:** I'm very begginer on javascript world, so I want to learn a lot about the language and when this challange was over, I need to be a good programmer, and web developer. Now I'm reading some blog posts very interesting like that: [Ten Things javascript](https://benmccormick.org/2017/07/19/ten-things-javascript/)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.
