# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 08, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Setting up Reactjs enviroment, reading about props, states, events, and webpack. Omg a lot of things I learned today.

**Thoughts:** I'm very begginer on javascript world, so I want to learn a lot about the language and when this challange was over, I need to be a good programmer, and web developer. Now I'm reading some blog posts very interesting like that: [Ten Things javascript](https://benmccormick.org/2017/07/19/ten-things-javascript/) 

### Day 1: January 09, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I Coded a very simple Hello World with Reactjs, and practice Js Strings, Arrays and another stuffs on [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard) a very interesting website that I found. And also read some articles about React.

**Thoughts:** I'm very excited becouse I'll start a online course about Javascript tomorrow on Udemy, and I found a very good website to practice to code [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard). With React for now the things are very slowly I've spent a lot of time thinking in what project to do, but I dont started anything today, maybe tomorrow I start some basic project.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.
**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
